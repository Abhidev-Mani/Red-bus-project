Objective of the Project

Automate the collection of bus travel data from the Redbus website using Selenium. This includes gathering detailed information such as:
* Bus routes
* Rating
* Schedules
* Ticket prices
* Seat availability

Store the scraped data in a structured SQL database, making it easier to access, manage, and analyze.

Develop a user-friendly Streamlit application to:

Display the collected data in an interactive interface.

Allow users to filter and analyze bus routes based on various criteria, such as bus type, route, price, ratings, and seat availability.


In Summary:
the project's goal is to streamline the process of collecting, filtering, and analyzing bus travel data, offering an efficient tool for decision-making and enhancing user experiences in the transportation sector.
